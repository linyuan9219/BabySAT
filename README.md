# BabySAT
I have been trying to get the CNF formula (boolean vectors) of a simple program by printing out bv in lcnf() function in "satcheck_minisat2.cpp". But when I compare the result with the CNF formula I get from --dimacs option, they do not match! And, clearly they are not logically equivalent, because the satisfiable assignment from one does not satisfy the other one.
